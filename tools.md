### The Browser <a id="the-browser"></a>

One of your biggest allies in writing websites is the web browser. You may not be yet aware but your browser has a myriad of developer tools built into it that help you understand your code, helps you find bugs, and helps you experiment directly on your running website. All of the modern browsers are great and you can use any one of them to develop sites with. 

#### Recommendation: Firefox <a id="my-recommendation-firefox"></a>

### The Editor <a id="the-editor"></a>

One of the most controversial things you can ask a developer is which editor is the best. There are so many strongly-held opinions that it's hard to tell which one is going to work for you. There are many flavors and it all depends on what you want out of your editor: do you want it to hold your hand as much as possible? Do you want it to get out of the way? I'm going to give you several choices but let's start with what I've been using for a few years now.

#### Recommedation: Visual Studio Code <a id="my-recommedation-visual-studio-code"></a>

### The Terminal <a id="the-terminal"></a>

For the terminal emulator, it doesn't matter a whole lot which one you use. I personally use [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/) but you can just as easily use the default Mac Terminal.app or [Hyper](https://hyper.is/) for Mac. For Windows, I'm told the aforementioned Hyper also works well as well as [cmder](http://cmder.net/). If you're on Linux, I'd say just use whatever the OS's default emulator is. You can use any one of these and this workshop will function entirely the same.

For the shell, we are going to use [bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/). You don't need to install it unless you're using Windows \([then use these steps to enable it](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10)\). It's 99% already there on your computer unless you're using some obscure flavor of Linux. Whenever you open your Mac terminal, it'll be running bash by default unless you've changed it.
