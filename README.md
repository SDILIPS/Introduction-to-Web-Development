# Succeeding at programming!

Many people have a preconceived notion that you have to be a wizard at Math to write code. On the contrary, the two subjects share some overlap but are quite different. There might be some mathematical component in Data science programming, but in Web development Math and coding are orthogonal to each other.

Also keep in mind that programming is _hard_. Learning how to code is hard. It's similar to learning a foreign language where you have to learn lots of small pieces of information to be able to make sense of the larger picture. It's easy to feel discouraged, especially when you feel like you _should_ get something but don't. Keep your head up and keep trying. 

Never feel afraid to Google _anything_. Every programmer you know, from the top person in the field to the newest student is Googling things _constantly_. This isn't cheating; it's a skill. It's a requirement. There is so much information coming at you that cannot possibly remember it all. Copy and paste code. Look at StackOverflow. Ask dumb questions. You get better by repeatedly exposing yourself to information. Each time a bit more will sink in.

Don't try to understand every piece all at once. There are times where it's okay to just trust that something works and come back later to understand how. It's a tough balance because you do want to try to understand what's going on. I'll try to signal to you what's worth diving into and what's worth leaving for another day but just know you don't have to understand it all at once.

Lastly, this isn't a get-rich-quick scheme. Learning to code is hard and requires a lot of hard work. While entry-level jobs are out there and you can get them with months of work, I guarantee you you'll have to work hard for them.
